          <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>
            <p>
              Recognized blockchain technology as a new way of doing Internet and made investments in early Ethereum. Current ICO/IDO investments in several blockchain projects, and Metaverses and NFTs. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              During the lockdowns, the time was used to learn Solidity Programming, to understand Smart Contracts, created Token and learned Token Economics, built Blockchain Dapps and a host of other technologies, softwares, frameworks, libraries and networks.  
            <br/> 
            <br/>
            React-Native to build IOS and Android Applications. HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, JQuerry and React.js to build front-end web apps and WordPress websites, running several ecommerce websites before the lockdowns. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The coolest part was learning three.js programming and using three.js libraries combined with WebGLRenderer to create and render really fun and cool 3D websites. 
         <br/>
         <br/>        
            Recognized blockchain as an entirely new way of immersive experience, the Matrix if you will, emerging with emergence of the 4th industrial revolution. An entirely new way of doing internet, shopping, business meetings and social meeting places, platfomrs and Metaverses. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Like IRLs for websites, Metaverses to have Metaverse Resource Locator addresses. Inside each Metaverse people will live as their own digital Avatars. They will buy and sell Avatars to represent themselves, to clothes the avatars, and  buy and sell other digital economic items merchandized and wrapped in the form of NFTs and bought and sold iniside these virtual reality matrixes called Metaverses.
            
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Entirely new markets and economies have emerged and will keep emerging, and an entirely new way of preceiving reality and illusion are begining to form. After all what is reality but vibrations of electric circcuits in the brain, preceived as reality.  
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Blockchain technology will usher in the 4th Industrial Revolution into reality. The potential new economies emerging within these Metaverses and gaming industries are enormous, and so too will the human experience forever altered.
